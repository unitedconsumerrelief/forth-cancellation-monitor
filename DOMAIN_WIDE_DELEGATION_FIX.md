# üö® CRITICAL: Domain-Wide Delegation Not Working

## The Problem
The Service Account Client ID `115899325751750890099` is **NOT authorized** for Gmail access in Google Workspace Admin.

Error: `"Client is unauthorized to retrieve access tokens using this method"`

## The Fix

### Step 1: Go to Google Workspace Admin Console
1. Go to [Google Workspace Admin Console](https://admin.google.com/)
2. Navigate to: **Security** ‚Üí **API Controls** ‚Üí **Domain-wide delegation**

### Step 2: Add/Update the Service Account
1. **Find the entry** with Client ID: `115899325751750890099`
2. **If it exists**: Click **Edit** and update the scopes
3. **If it doesn't exist**: Click **Add new** and enter:
   - **Client ID**: `115899325751750890099`
   - **OAuth Scopes**: `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.readonly`

### Step 3: Verify the Setup
The entry should look like:
```
Client ID: 115899325751750890099
OAuth Scopes: https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.readonly
```

### Step 4: Test Again
After updating, the Gmail API calls should work without the "unauthorized_client" error.

## Why This Happened
The Domain-Wide Delegation was set up but either:
1. The wrong Client ID was used
2. The scope was incorrect
3. The authorization was not properly saved

## Current Status
- ‚úÖ Service Account credentials are loading correctly
- ‚úÖ Domain-Wide Delegation code is working
- ‚ùå **Google Workspace Admin authorization is missing/incorrect**

Once this is fixed, the application will work perfectly.
